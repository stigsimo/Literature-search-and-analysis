This repo consits of three parts:
1) search the semantic scholar database for papers
2) analyze the papers
3) visualize the results

For the time beeing there is some manual transfer of files and information when performing step 2 and 3. 
the code is written in a jupyter notebook with comments so it should be possible to understand what must be done.

To make the generation of topic names work you need an api key for openai. insert the key in the config_LLM file and rename to "config_LLM.txt"
